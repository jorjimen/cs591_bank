#### DESIGN PATTERNS TO INCORPORATE

1. Singleton Pattern - design so that there is only 1 bank, 1 stock market, and 1 bank manager created 
2. Factory Pattern - create an AccountFactory class with a getAccount() method that will return an Account object (can be checking, savings, securities, or loan) 
3. Facade Pattern - design the interface for the customer so that all the methods and other complex code is not visible
4. Observer Pattern - have the customers observe something (the Manager or the Stock Market could be the subject) so that they are notified of changes to their account or changes in the market
